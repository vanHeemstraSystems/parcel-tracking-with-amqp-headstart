# 400 - Conclusion

Microservice structures are becoming more and more preferred structures in new applications. Software teams are working to migrate existing monolith structures to microservice architectures. 

In addition, AMQP stands out as a highly preferred communication protocol and provides solutions to some problems experienced with HTTP. 

On the end-user side, the interest and demand for real-time applications are also increasing and here web sockets provide great convenience to the software developer. It is a pleasure to master these tools, which are used to respond to new demands and new technologies, and it contributes a lot to the developer. 

Throughout this article, I wrote a small service and tried to provide a general understanding by using these structures and technologies in summary. I hope it has contributed to those who read, follow, and apply.
