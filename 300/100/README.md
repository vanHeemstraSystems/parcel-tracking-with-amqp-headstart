First of all, let’s create a folder called ***containers***. In that folder, let’s create one more folder called ***app*** and inside of this one more folder called ***api***. Then open up a terminal and go to the directory where our ```api``` folder is you just created and run ***npm init -y***.

```
$ mkdir containers
$ cd containers
$ mkdir app
$ cd app
$ mkdir api
$ cd api
$ npm init -y
```
