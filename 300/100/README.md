# 100 - Server

First of all, let’s create a folder called ***parcel-tracking-system***. In that folder, let’s create one more folder called ***server***. Then open up a terminal and go to the directory where our server folder is you just created and run ***npm init -y***.

```
$ mkdir parcel-tracking-system
$ cd parcel-tracking-system
$ mkdir server
$ cd server
```
